# Implementation Plan for OKR-App

This document outlines a detailed step-by-step implementation plan for the development of the Table Rock OKR Management Platform. The plan is structured to guide the development team through the initial setup, feature implementation, testing, security measures, deployment, and post-launch tasks.

## 1. Initialize Project

### Framework Setup
- Choose the tech stack: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Supabase.
- Initialize a new Next.js application with TypeScript support using `create-next-app`.
- Set up version control using Git and create a GitHub repository for code management.

### Folder Structure
- Organize the folder structure for clear separation of concerns:
  - `/components`: Reusable React components.
  - `/pages`: Next.js pages.
  - `/api`: API route handlers.
  - `/styles`: Tailwind CSS and PostCSS configurations.
  - `/utils`: Utility functions and helpers.

### Tooling Configuration
- Configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS for styling.
- Set up ESLint for code linting and maintain code quality.
- Configure Webpack for module bundling and optimization.
- Install necessary dependencies: `npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer eslint next react react-dom @supabase/supabase-js`.

## 2. Set Up Auth

### Auth Provider Integration
- Integrate Supabase Auth for authentication using passwordless OTP codes.
- Configure Supabase with Row Level Security (RLS) for multi-tenant architecture.

### Login/Signup Flow Implementation
- Implement a multi-step registration flow:
  - Access code validation.
  - Organization setup.
  - OTP verification.
- Develop login and signup pages with UI components for email input and OTP verification.

## 3. Build Frontend Pages

### Order of Page Creation
1. **Landing Page**: Highlight exclusive access and features.
2. **Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into organizational performance.
3. **OKR Management**: Create, edit, and track OKRs with hierarchical relationships.
4. **Team Management**: Manage teams, roles, and user permissions.
5. **Session Management**: Handle session lifecycles (Open, In Progress, Archived).

### Component Dependencies
- Develop reusable components such as modals, forms, progress bars, and charts using Recharts.
- Use Radix UI for accessible UI components and Lucide React for icons.

## 4. Create Backend Endpoints

### API Development Sequence
- Develop RESTful API endpoints in the following order:
  - Authentication: Login, signup, OTP verification.
  - OKR Management: CRUD operations for objectives and key results.
  - Team Management: CRUD operations for teams and user roles.
  - Session Management: Handle session lifecycle transitions.
  - Reporting & Analytics: Generate and export reports.

## 5. Connect Frontend â†” Backend

### API Integration
- Use `@supabase/supabase-js` to connect frontend with Supabase for data operations.
- Implement state management using React Context API or Zustand for global state.

### State Management Setup
- Set up global state for user authentication, OKR data, and session status.
- Ensure real-time updates using Supabase Realtime for collaborative features.

## 6. Add 3rd Party Integrations

### Integrations
- Email: Configure email notifications for user events and updates.
- Analytics: Integrate a tool like Google Analytics for usage tracking.
- Calendar: Sync calendar events for session timelines and deadlines.
- Webhooks: Set up webhooks for real-time notifications and automated workflows.

## 7. Test Features

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Write tests for individual components and utilities using Jest.
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components and API endpoints.
- **E2E Tests**: Use Cypress for end-to-end testing of user flows.
- **Test Data Setup**: Create mock data and scenarios for testing.

## 8. Security Checklist

### Security Measures
- Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
- Validate all input to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Utilize Supabase's RLS for data isolation and privacy.
- Ensure passwordless authentication is secure and reliable.

## 9. Deployment Steps

### Build Process
- Optimize the build process using Next.js production build (`next build`).

### Environment Configuration
- Set up environment variables for API keys, Supabase credentials, etc.

### Hosting Setup
- Deploy the application on Vercel for seamless integration with Next.js.
- Configure Supabase as the backend service.

## 10. Post-Launch Tasks

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Implement monitoring tools for performance tracking and error logging.
- Analyze user behavior and feature usage through analytics.

### User Feedback Collection
- Set up feedback collection mechanisms such as surveys or feedback forms.
- Use feedback to prioritize future feature development and improvements.

By following this implementation plan, the development team will ensure a structured and efficient development process for the OKR-App, leading to a successful product launch and ongoing improvements based on user feedback.
