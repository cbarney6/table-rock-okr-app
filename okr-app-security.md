# Security Guidelines Document for Table Rock OKR Management Platform

## Authentication & Authorization Rules

### OAuth Flows
- **Passwordless Authentication**: Utilize email-based One-Time Passwords (OTP) for user authentication.
  - Implement 6-digit OTP codes with a 5-minute frontend countdown and 1-hour backend expiration.
  - Ensure the first user in an organization automatically becomes an admin.
- **Invite-Only Access**: 
  - Use time-limited, usage-tracked access codes distributed by administrators for exclusive client access.
  - Admin email invitation functionality to send registration invites to new users.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Define roles (Admin, User, View-Only) with specific permissions for data access and actions within the platform.
  - Implement Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for organization-based data isolation.

### JWT Handling
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management after successful OTP authentication.
- Ensure tokens are signed using a secure algorithm (e.g., RS256).
- Implement token expiration and rotation policies to enhance security.

## Data Validation Rules

### Input Sanitization
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other injection attacks.
- Use libraries such as DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML inputs.

### Type Checking
- Implement type checking for all inputs using TypeScript to ensure data integrity and prevent type-related vulnerabilities.

### Boundary Validation
- Validate input boundaries (e.g., string lengths, numerical ranges) to prevent buffer overflow and related issues.

## Environment Variables

### Secure Configuration
- Store sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and JWT secrets in environment variables.
- Use a secure environment variable management system (e.g., Vercel's secret management) to prevent unauthorized access.

## Rate Limiting/Throttling

### Limits per Endpoint
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
- Define limits such as requests per minute per user/IP address to ensure fair usage.

### DDoS Protection
- Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.
- Monitor traffic patterns for unusual spikes and automatically trigger protection mechanisms.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Secure Error Messages
- Display generic error messages to users while logging detailed error information internally.
- Avoid exposing stack traces or sensitive information in error messages.

### Logging Practices
- Log authentication attempts, authorization failures, and significant user actions.
- Use secure logging practices, ensuring logs are stored securely and are accessible to authorized personnel only.

## Security Headers/Configs

### CORS Settings
- Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow requests only from trusted domains.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Implement a robust CSP to prevent XSS attacks by defining trusted sources for content.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- Enforce HTTPS across the platform to protect data in transit using TLS encryption.

## Dependency Management

### Package Updates
- Regularly update all dependencies to the latest stable versions to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools such as Dependabot to automate dependency checks and updates.

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Conduct regular vulnerability scans using tools like Snyk or npm audit to identify and address security issues in dependencies.

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest using AES-256 encryption.
- Ensure data in transit is encrypted using TLS to protect against interception.

### PII Handling
- Implement strict access controls for Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data.
- Regularly review and audit access logs to detect unauthorized access attempts.

By following these security guidelines, the Table Rock OKR Management Platform can ensure a robust security posture, protecting sensitive organizational data and maintaining client trust.
